### Step Functions
Step functions are used to create workflows consist of multiple services to automate processes.
Step functions are based on *state machines* and *tasks*. State machines are the workflows. Each step in workflow is called *state*.
Each time a step function runs performing tasks, it is reffered as *execution*.
